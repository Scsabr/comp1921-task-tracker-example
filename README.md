# comp1921-task-tracker-example

My personal breakdown of the to-do list tracker task from 12/02 lecture.

Mine is probably a bit more code-y than others- I like to think about how I will do things.

I'm also considering memory allocation and how I would use dynamic memory - you may have done this with static allocation.

You will note that:

- I have tried to make some functions more reusable (display_bool and get_choice especially)
- I have functions even though I only do things once - keeping my code better separated

My breakdown isn't the only possible option, you could do this in many different ways :)
